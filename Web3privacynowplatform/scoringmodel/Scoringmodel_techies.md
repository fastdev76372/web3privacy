# Privacy scoring modelling > Web3privacy now analytical [platform](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/tree/main/Web3privacynowplatform)

_Currently we are surveying developers, security engineers and  researchers to find out bottle necks & potential room for growth within privacy features assessment by techies._ [raw data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWpAsGL10UTsVeuIVbouzUxRjaSPUAamxcbFljXuUWE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Core user group (techies definition):
- junior or general devs with under 1-year web3 coding experience
- poor security auditing skills
- general interest in privacy tech

## Why this group
- general public within the devs landscape is the most vulnerable audience compared to mature decs with connections & experience
- generalisation helps to make universal tooling & secure research from the niche approaches

## General scoring will consist of
- audit check up (manual)
- scoring features
- dev toolkit
- DYOR expanded track (subjective observations)

## Quick take from market assessment 
- devs lack the basics of security audits (while auditing companies or security engineers create piles of written that require lots of dev hours to read & more to understand)
- case studies could help to "visualize" the assessment journey
- DB of the malicious practices & critical bugs within the privacy landscape will come in handy for practical devs

**Hypothesis**: can the market create a standard of cross-project privacy features check-up increasing general privacy stack levelling? 

**Crucial scoring context**: time on research x potential amount of privacy anti-features detection. Meaning that scoring could be scalable if more people will use it under the economy, general business & without expert knowledge level.

# MVP for non-techies expanded to techies

**important note**: here "techies" covers "juniors" & general "developers" (masses) & not aplicable to "lead", "seniors" or even "mid"-devs (core devs).

# Scoring model 1.3: validity track

_Validity track covers GitHub, Product-readiness, Team, Docs, Audit._

**Note**: quick assessment helps to decrease privacy dark patterns from obscure language to test-net claiming it has a "state of art privacy".

# Sandbox

**Extended scoring 1.0**
| Project | GitHub | Product-readiness | Team | Docs | Audit | Contributors | Licenses | Support | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Test project** | available & active GitHub / not (25%) | Live or 🚧 (exclusion criteria) | public team / not (25%) | available & not marketing docs / not (25%) | available & up to date third-party audit / not (25%) | external contributors outside of the team members | What licenses are in use | Some form of support available? (telegram, discord, forum) | from 0 to 100% |
| **score** | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 100% |

**Updates 1.2**

## **GitHub**
* Is it in stable release, 1.0 and not an alpha or untested code?
* Are there many PRs and Issues pending?
* Are there external contributors outside of the team members? [Waku example](https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku)
* What are licenses in use? [Privy Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing)

**example**: _Free & Open Source Software is the foundation that enables you to check whatever you want. The hoprd client is released under [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/master/LICENSE) that allows you to do that (and also modify and re-distribute) Hoprn freely_

## **Docs**
- read the documentation: is it comprehensive?
- how well-written are privacy & security assumptions/guarantees?
- if aplicable: how well-written is encryption method? [example](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/encryption)
- is Whitepaper marketing or dev-centric?

## **Team**
* Check if there are known contributors (reputation 101)
* Check commits at GitHub
* How many community contributors beyond core team?
* How many technical specialists in the team?
* How mature are core contributors (previous projects, GitHub commits)?

## **Third-party audit**
- Were bugs fixed? [Zokyo x Railgun_ example, p.7](https://assets.railgun.org/docs/audits/2023-02-03%20Zokyo.pdf)
- How centralized are product updates?

## **Infrastructure**
| Scoring  | Techie |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Where are the nodes (check block explorer) [Nym mainnet explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net) | + |
| Number of nodes (the larger the footprint the best privacy) | + |

## **Dependencies**
| Scoring  | Techie |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| check the dependencies, more dependencies means more risk of security vulnerabilities and more risk of network code that can leak your IP or personal data | + |
| read terms and conditions of every third party dependency, its licenses and what network calls are made by simply adding the library to the project even when not being used | + |

_Tools_: [Json analyzer](https://github.com/u4aew/package-json-analyzer), [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck)

**example**: Rabby - 1150 dependencies, Metamask - 720, Brume - 50 [link](https://twitter.com/hazae41/status/1750478720140280259)

## **3rd party libraries**
- Audit libraries in use
- Do they have a third-party audit?
- What's the reputation behind the library team?
- What's the reputation behind security audit company?

## **Traction**
| Scoring  | Techie |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Amount of transactions (Dune, DeFi Lama, block explorer etc) | + |
| number of people using it | + |

## **Governance**

| DAO structure (if applied)  | + |
| How centralized is the protocol governance? [Railgun_ governance docs](https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/rail-token/protocol-governance) | + |

## **Traceability**

**example 1**: Railgun
1. Use @Railway_xyz to send a private transfer to a 0zk address through a Relayer. 
2. Examine the "receipt" of that transfer on etherscan or arbiscan.  You will not find: (1) sender, (2) receiver, (3) token or (4) amount anywhere in the transaction receipt.

https://t.co/PqkUJWwmPD
* This is a 0zk -> 0zk transaction (sending tokens from one #DeFi user to another. You'll note that the scan has a from address but this is simply a Relayer address that pays gas to process the on-chain computation).
* User communications with a Relayer are passed via through the @waku_org p2p gossip network, so Relayers can't know a particular message origin. In other words, even here #privacy was a big consideration throughout the tech stack not just on Etherscan.
* The To address is simply the RAILGUN smart contract on @0xPolygon in this case. So nothing is revealed about the recipient.
* The value that exchanged hands? #Private
* Try to decode the input data for the transaction? It's all #encrypted.
* So how much money exchanged hands here? Well, the short answer here is - it's #private. 
* Only the sender and recipient will know. There will be #zeroknowledge about it unless they choose to reveal the transaction information.

**example 2**: HOPR

The only user of HOPR is actually @RPC_h_- so I'd check if that is private. 

1. Use http://DERP.hoprnet.org in your normal wallet.
2. See how every request from your wallet gets disclosed via the website.
3. Then install RPCh.
4. Connect it to the DERP endpoint
5. And see that no request is visible on the page anymore, because the requests are sent via other IP addresses.

**example**: dm3

The criteria for a messenger or messaging protocol/service to proof "privacy by design":
- decentralized delivery network (no central instance controls the flow/storage/transmission of messages or identity information)
- decentralized registry for communication info (no entity controls the information how to encrypt and deliver messages)
- end-2-end encryption, ideally with PFS (every message is end-to-end encrypted, ideally with rotating keys (PFS, ...))
- Messages are not stored in the network (web3 storage like IPFS-based storage is critical as we never know if the encryption will be secure in the future, if not, this info is public)
- no traceable transmission (transmission of messages must be not traceable from outside, as this may reveal the connection)
- open-source of security-relevant parts (closed systems can't be trusted to not have backdoors)

**example**: MASQ Browser
1. Have you tried the MASQ Browser
2. Run a cli node on a VPServer
3. Read the docs on docs.masq.ai
4. Break TLS at first as there is a TLS connection from the MASQ Browser to the destination web server.
5. Analyze https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node

**example**: Penumbra
1. Run a node and see what data is synced from the network.
2. Check out the various RPCs like get block by height and see that the transaction data is encrypted (aside from what is intended to be public like fees).
3. Look in the local pcli database and see that only your transactions are present in decrypted form.

_Verifying the confidentiality/integrity of the encryption is its own whole topic that requires cryptographic expertise however._

**example**: OMNIA

_off-chain privacy_ - mostly protecting metadata like the IP address of the one making the request. Algorithm to validate this: set up a dummy RPC node (i.e. using netcat or anything), register it in a load balancer in OMNIA, then make requests to OMNIA LB endpoint. The expected result is that you will not see your original IP in the data you receive on the dummy node, but rather random proxy addresses used to protect customer data

_private transactions_ also known as transaction sent through private mempool. Algorithm to validate this (for now only mainnet):

1. Send a transaction through a frontrunning protected endpoint.
2. Look at the transaction with a third-party explorer like Etherscan.
3. The expected result is that you'll see a label of "MEV Transaction"/"Private Transaction" which usually means the tx was sent through a private mempool, hidden from the bots etc that are eyeing the public mempool.

Example here [link](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf12371347f409ea7e5e674bd435ee1ad269af5d82cb74d4998ad57b3ab673609)

**example**: Firn

1. Look at an existing withdrawal on Etherscan. see if you can understand why the identity of the withdrawer is hidden. see if you can understand what information is visible (zkp, timing, withdrawal amount, etc.). here's an example: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0b070e834c040e516503c9fe435b45fa03038b68f1157253c0eddaed9d682617
2. Skim through the code of all of our contracts, especially Firn.sol. try to understand the rough architecture, blackboxing for now the actual zkp.
  3. github https://github.com/firnprotocol/contracts/blob/mainnet/Firn.sol
  4. etherscan https://etherscan.io/address/0x4ce75eafd588f36de4b4b6e15f5e4e44b2e67aa0#code
5. do basic Firn transactions or two. 
6. open the developer tools console. 
7. inspect all outbound traffic (network tab).

**example**: Waku

1. Read the doc to understand at high level
2. Read the specs to understand exact behaviour and limitations
3. Check code
4. Run code and look at the network/libp2p logs:
5. What node it's connecting too
6. What messages are being sent.

_tools_: 
- something like netstat would be enough to see the connections made by the node. Or just using network tool in the browser.
- enabling libp2p logs would be a good start.

| Trustless - No ID required (this is where ZKs are useful) | + |

**example**: "with the unirep protocol we're building an explorer that shows all the things happening in the system. So a user could see their epoch keys and attestations and see how they're distinct in the system. One thing we might do is write what can and can't be determined about the different identifiers".

## Testing

| ------------- | ------------- |
| try to trace a transaction | + |
| Other tooling to verify e.g. block explorers  | + |

## Tooling
- **Wireshark on the Docker container** to check what it interfaces
- &/or **Console** - check network requests by opening the console, the more requests it does to external servers, the more your IP address is sent around
- Etherscan - transactional analytics
- [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck) - dependencies

## Advanced part

from community

* use a packet inspection tool such as #Wireshark to check all packets coming into your machine and going out
* using something like https://charlesproxy.com to see all the traffic
* Android: Feel free to test it at [Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/), a friendly service to investigate Android apps. 
* Android: check https://f-droid.org and verify the “no anti-features” tag (like dependency on third-party services). [Example](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nighthawkapps.wallet.android/)
